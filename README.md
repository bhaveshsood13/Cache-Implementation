# Implementation of 3 Different Designs of Cache 
This is a `C++` program to show the implementation of a Cache in a Computer .

The different types of Caches implemented are :
1. Fully Associative Cache
1. Direct Mapped Cache
1. Set Associative Cache

This program helps us understand how does a Cache work exactly using the Tag and Data Array 
and what are the different constraints of different designs.
